                            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Half of your plate should be vegetables and fruits:</strong> These are rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber, which are essential for your body's proper functioning.</li>
                            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Include lean proteins:</strong> Such as chicken, fish, beans, or tofu. Proteins are the building blocks of your muscles and are crucial for recovery and energy.</li>

                            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Don’t forget healthy fats:</strong> Include sources of healthy fats like avocados, nuts, and olive oil to support brain function and overall health.</li>
                            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Stay hydrated:</strong> Drink plenty of water throughout the day to help your body process nutrients and maintain energy levels.</li>
